This is a static HTML GitHub Pages site for https://codeforgreenville.org.

Note: GitHub pages makes it sound like it supports [redirects for the apex domain AND the www domain](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages#using-an-apex-domain-for-your-github-pages-site), but it only redirects for http://.  [The redirect does not work for https and is not supported](https://andygrove.io/2018/05/github-pages-custom-domain-ssl/).
