<p>The group formerly known as Code For Greenville, and this GitHub Pages hosted website for the codeforgreenville.org domain, existed from 2014 into 2023.</p>

<p>As of June 30, 2023, <a href="https://codeforamerica.org/news/reflections-on-the-brigade-networks-next-chapter/">Code For America officially withdrew fiscal sponsorship and use of the "Code For" trademark to <strong>all</strong> national brigades</a>, including Code For Greenville.</p>

<p>After July 1st, 2023, contributors can get involved with two re-branded efforts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>For ongoing civic projects, connect with <a href="https://codeforthecarolinas.org/">Code For The Carolina</a>&nbsp;(which itself will rebrand by the end of 2023)</li>
	<li>For local tech APIs and OpenData projects, see the <a href="https://github.com/hackgvl">HackGreenville Labs repositories on GitHub</a> and connect with the team in the #hg-labs channel on the <a href="https://hackgreenville.com/join-slack">HackGreenville Slack</a></li>
</ul>

Note: GitHub pages makes it sound like it supports [redirects for the apex domain AND the www domain](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages#using-an-apex-domain-for-your-github-pages-site), but it only redirects for http://.  [The redirect does not work for https and is not supported](https://andygrove.io/2018/05/github-pages-custom-domain-ssl/).
