This is a static HTML GitHub Pages site for https://codeforgreenville.org.

It was originally setup using the Jekyll site generator, but when we paired the site down to just a homepage it was more expedient to manipulate the index.html than to learn and re-create the site generator environment.

So, editing the index.html and related HTML resources will shortly thereafter update the site on https://codeforgreenville.org.

Note: GitHub pages makes it sound like it supports [redirects for the apex domain AND the www domain](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages#using-an-apex-domain-for-your-github-pages-site), but it only redirects for http://.  [The redirect does not work for https and is not supported](https://andygrove.io/2018/05/github-pages-custom-domain-ssl/).
