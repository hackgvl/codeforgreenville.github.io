<h1>Application Details</h1>

<p><a href="https://github.com/okfn/ckan#sthash.sdB744rs.dpuf">GitHub Repository</a></p>

<p>Live Sites:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.data.gov/">US Government Data Portal</a></li>

<h1>What is it?</h1>

<p>Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network (CKAN) is a web-based open source data management system for the storage and distribution of data, such as spreadsheets and the contents of databases. It is maintained by the <a href="http://us.okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a>. It uses its internal model to store metadata about the different records, and presents it on a web interface that allows users to browse and search this metadata. It also offers an API that allows third-party applications and services to be built around it.</p>

<h1>Evaluation for Greenville</h1>

<h2>1. <strong>Will this App be helpful to the citizens of greenville?</strong></h2>

<p>Only indirectly. This application could be deployed by any city who wishes to launch their own data portal. It makes it much simpler for the community to build applications based on the data stored on it.</p>

<h2>2. <strong>Will the citizens of greenville use this application?</strong></h2>

<p>This application is most useful to application developers, researchers, journalists, educators and businesses with an interest in civic data.</p>

<h2>3. <strong>Has the App been re-deployed by another brigade?</strong></h2>

<p>Yes. Open Oakland and Code for DC have deployed it for their cities.</p>

<h2>4. <strong>What are the technical depedencies?</strong></h2>

<ul>
<li>Python backend</li>
<li>Javascript frontend</li>
<li>Pylons web framework</li>
<li>SQLAlchemy ORM</li>
<li>PostgreSQL</li>
<li>SOLR search</li>
<li>modular architecture that allows extensions to be developed</li>
</ul>


<h2>5. <strong>What are the data dependencies?</strong></h2>

<p>There are no data dependencies for this application.</p>

<h2>6. <strong>How much does it cost to deploy and maintain?</strong></h2>

<p>Unknown. As a Portal for the Brigade hosting is likely minimal. OKFN offers hosted solutions from a variety of partners for city and national level portals so we can likely get a decent estimate from them when it comes time to deploy it for a local city.</p>

<p><a href="http://datahub.io/">Datahub.io</a> is a web service based on CKAN which is community owned and driven. Not all of the CKAN functionality is available but it is free.</p>

<h2>7. <strong>How can we contribute or improve the app if we deploy it?</strong></h2>

<p>The project has an <a href="http://ckan.org/developers/roadmap/">extensive roadmap</a> we could contribute toward.</p>

<h1>What is it?</h1>

<p>The <a href="http://ohanapi.org/">Ohana API</a> is an open directory of social services. The API itself is a database and set of commands (Aplication Programming Interface or API) that allows the database to be changed in a standardized way. It comes with and Admin Site to permit organizations to update their own information. It also comes with a Search Site to consume the API data and display the information to users. The whole thing is based on the Open Referral Data Model. There is also an SMS interface powered(Relevant Links above)</p>

<h1>Evaluation for Greenville</h1>

<h2>1. <strong>Will this App be helpful to the citizens of greenville?</strong></h2>

<ul>
<li>It would be very helpful to the citizens using county or non profit social services to navigate a complete system.</li>
<li>It would be helpful to social service case workers guiding individuals and families thought the assistance landscape.</li>
<li>It would be helpful to greenville county non profits to know which orgnaizations to get users from and which organizations to send users to once their mission is complete.</li>
</ul>


<h2>2. <strong>Will the citizens of greenville use this application?</strong></h2>

<p> If citizens know about it and need the services they are likely to use it. The key will be on-boarding social service organizations and teaching their staff to use the search site in their day to day workflow. Once the service organizations are using it and sharing it with their constituents are likely to follow suit. We will need to educate common public internet access points like the county libraries that the site exists and how to use it.</p>

<h2>3. <strong>Has the App been re-deployed by another brigade?</strong></h2>

<p> No</p>

<h2>4. <strong>What are the technical depedencies?</strong></h2>

<h4>API Dependencies</h4>

<ul>
<li>PostgresDB</li>
<li>Human Services Data Specification</li>
<li>Ruby version 2.1.1</li>
<li>Rails version 4.0.4</li>
<li>Redis</li>
<li>API framework: Grape</li>
<li>Testing Frameworks: RSpec, Factory Girl, Capybara</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api-dev-box">OSX VM</a></li>

<h4>SMS Interface Dependencies</h4>

<ul>
<li>Ruby (version?)</li>
<li>Heroku Deployment</li>
<li><a href="https://www.tropo.com/">Tropo</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>5. <strong>How much does it cost to deploy and maintain?</strong></h2>

<p>Unknown. We might be able to run the entire suite on a docker server and keep it pretty cheap. We need to chat with the SMC site maintainers to get a better idea of how the application scales with use. The SMS component might have additional usage fees via the Tropo service.</p>

<h2>6. <strong>What are the data dependencies?</strong></h2>

<p>There are no civic data dependencies. Greenville County and City services could be added at anytime. Municipal partners could be trained to update their own information or an annual civic write-a-thon event could be held to update the information on behalf of the city.</p>

<h2>7. <strong>How can we contribute or improve the app if we deploy it?</strong></h2>

<p> A community guide to redeployment and a streamlined Docker deployment process would be very helpful.</p>

<h1>What is it?</h1>

<p>Development FastPass combines parcel data, land use, zoning, building occupancy, and business incentives to help business owners research the best options to locate their businesses within Las Vegas.</p>

<h1>Evaluation for Greenville</h1>

<h2>1. <strong>Will this App be helpful to the citizens of greenville?</strong></h2>

<p>   This app helps make sense of a variety of local regulations regarding buisness location in a city. The app could be very useful in encouraging buisness growth in Greenville by making it simpler to find suitable locations for new businesses.</p>

<h2>2. <strong>Will the citizens of greenville use this application?</strong></h2>

<p>   if they are interested in starting a business its likely they will use it.</p>

<h2>3. <strong>Has the App been re-deployed by another brigade?</strong></h2>

<p>   no. it will likely have a variety of challenges or bugs to iron out.</p>

<h2>4. <strong>What are the technical depedencies?</strong></h2>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a> &amp; <a href="http://expressjs.com/">ExpressJS</a></li>
<li> The App Repository lacks robust redeployment documentation. We will likely have a good bit of figuring out to do.

<h2>5. <strong>What are the data dependencies?</strong></h2>

<p>This application will require access to experts on city development staff to help formalize rules &amp; regulations.</p></li>
<li>. Zoning Rules need to be formalized</li>
<li>. Parcel Data required (location and attributes)</li>
<li>. City &amp; Neighborhood geographic definitions</li>
<li>. Business Licensing Codes (needs to be mapped to North American Industry Classification System &ndash; NAICS)</li>
</ul>


<h2>6. <strong>How much does it cost to deploy and maintain?</strong></h2>

<p>   unknown. Likely it will not cost much, its not a big application.</p>

<h2>7. <strong>How can we contribute or improve the app if we deploy it?</strong></h2>

<p>   Since it hasn&rsquo;t been redeployed a comprehensive redeployment guide would be a major contribution to the community.</p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/43632898#">Concept and Use Video</a></p>

<h1>What is it?</h1>

<p>Honolulu Answers is a citizen-focused website that is question-driven, with clean, easy-to-navigate design. You can ask a question or type in keywords using plain language. You&rsquo;ll receive simple, friendly, concise, easy-to-understand responses, as though they&rsquo;re coming from a neighbor.</p>

<h1>Evaluation for Greenville</h1>

<h2>1. <strong>Will this App be helpful to the citizens of greenville?</strong></h2>

<p>   possibly, if  citizens are frustrated with the <a href="http://greenvillesc.gov/">current site</a> it might be helpful.</p>

<h2>2. <strong>Will the citizens of greenville use this application?</strong></h2>

<p>   open for discussion</p>

<h2>3. <strong>Has the App been re-deployed by another brigade?</strong></h2>

<p>   Yes. Open Oakland Redeployed it in 2013.</p>

<p>None. This site runs on data generated by citizens (both questions and answers) at a <a href="http://codeforamerica.github.io/honolulu-writeathon/">&ldquo;write-a-thon&rdquo;</a> event that is then reviewed by city staff for accuracy. Answers will link back to existing content on the city&rsquo;s normal site.</p>

<h2>6. <strong>How much does it cost to deploy and maintain?</strong></h2>

<p>   a good question. It looks like the city of honolulu is picking up the tab for the service accounts for their app. I&rsquo;ll check with the CfA folks and see if we can get an estimate from Honolulu or Oakland.</p>

<h2>7. <strong>How can we contribute or improve the app if we deploy it?</strong></h2>

<p>   There are a couple of hack requests open we could contribute to:</p>

<ol>
<li>.  <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/hack-requests/blob/master/answers-community-kit.md">Answers Community Event Kit</a> The write-a-thon community kit should be a web-based, step-by-step guide to running a write-a-thon. <a href="http://neighborhow.org/guides/host-a-writeathon-in-your-city">something more robust than this presumably</a>.</li>
<li>. <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/hack-requests/blob/master/answers-visitor-display.md">Answers Analytics Features</a> Add a completely-public baked-in analytics view, so any visitor can see what&rsquo;s being looked at.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>About Redeployment &amp; The Spotlight Series</h1>

<p>One of the primary goals of the Code for Greenville Brigade is to contribute to the spread of Open Civic Tech. One big way to contribute to the community at large and knock out a quick win as a Brigade is to <strong>Redeploy</strong> other apps that were developed in other cities by other brigades. This allows us to stand on the shoulders of our peers in other cities and gives us an opportunity to improve their work and pay it forward. In the weeks to come we are going to post a series of posts highlighting applications the Code for Greenville Brigade might want to consider redeploying.</p>

<h1>What are we looking for?</h1>

<p>Some key factors we should consider before we redeploy an application:</p>

<ol>
<li>Will this App be helpful to the citizens of greenville?</li>
<li>Will the citizens of greenville use this application?</li>
<li>Has the App been re-deployed by another brigade?</li>
<li>What are the technical depedencies?</li>
<li>What are the data dependencies?</li>
<li>How much does it cost to deploy and maintain?</li>
<li>How can we contribute or improve the app if we deploy it?</li>
</ol>


<h1>How you can help</h1>

<ol>
<li>Take a look at each application. Poke around and see what you think about it.</li>
<li>Then ask yourself &ldquo;Would this app be helpful to me? and &#8220;Would I use this App?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Then go ask 2 other greenville citizens the same question. try to pick folks with a different background. see what kind of answers you get.</li>
<li>Now think about Greenville &ndash; what should we consider if we were to deploy this app? Is there something about our town culture or our environment we need to account for or represent?</li>
<li>If your feeling adventurous dive into the apps github site and dive into the code and see what you think.</li>
</ol>


<p>Finally Bring your thoughts back to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-Greenville-Brigade/messages/archive/">meetup discussion</a> or the next <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-Greenville-Brigade/">meetup</a> and help up decide what apps Code for Greenville will be deploying.</p>
